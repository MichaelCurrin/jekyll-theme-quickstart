# Jekyll Theme Quickstart Demo
> Demonstrate building a custom theme on GitHub Pages

This site on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-theme-quickstart/tree/gh-pages) branch uses the Remote Theme plugin to fetch the theme from the project's [master](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-theme-quickstart/tree/master) branch.
