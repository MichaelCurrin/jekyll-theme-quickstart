# Jekyll Theme Quickstart Demo
> Demonstrate building a custom theme on GitHub Pages

This is a demo site on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-theme-quickstart/tree/gh-pages) branch.

It uses the Remote Theme plugin to fetch the theme from the project's own [master](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-theme-quickstart/tree/master) branch. The plugin can get any Jekyll theme which is hosted as a GitHub repo and has a gemspec file in its root. This elegant as you can switch themes by changing values in your config and Gemfile only, without having to fork or copy the entire theme.
